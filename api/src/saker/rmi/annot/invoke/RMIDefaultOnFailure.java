/**
 * If a remote method call fails due to RMI runtime failures, the default implementation of the method will be called.
 * <p>
 * Only interface with default implementation can be annotated with this class.
 * <p>
 * If a remote method call fails due to any RMI error, i.e. an subclass of {@link RMIRuntimeException} is thrown, then
 * the default implementation for the interface method will be called.
 * <p>
 * Note: If the method implementation explicitly throws an exception then the default implementation will not be called.
 * I.e. if a method issues a <code>throw</code> statement then the thrown exception will be propagated to the caller
 * over the connection instead of calling the default implementation.
 * <p>
 * If the default implementation throws an exception, the causing {@link RMIRuntimeException} instance will be added as
 * suppressed to it.
