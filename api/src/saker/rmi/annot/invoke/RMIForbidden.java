/**
 * Forbids calling an annotated method via RMI.
 * <p>
 * If a method is annotated with this class then calling it on a remote proxy object will cause an
 * {@link RMICallForbiddenException} to be thrown.
 * <p>
 * If the method is also annotated with {@link RMIDefaultOnFailure} then the default implementation will be called.
 * <p>
 * If the method is also annotated with {@link RMIExceptionRethrow} then the specified exception type will be thrown
 * instead.
 * <p>
 * When designing security sensitive applications, using this annotation on the server side interface definition doesn't
 * protect against remote calls issued by the client. I.e. The annotated method may still be called by a malicious
 * client.
